Whether you’re looking to feel more confident, improve your strength, or simply feel healthier, it can help to know if you’re making progress. Think about what your unique goals are and how those would be best measured. If you’re wanting to build strength with progressive overload, you could use the Sweat app to keep track of the weights you’re lifting. If you’re wanting to feel more confident and healthy, you could use a journal to record how you’re feeling. If you’re wanting to build endurance, you could complete regular fitness challenges and track your progress."',
